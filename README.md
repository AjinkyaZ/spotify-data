# Spotify-data  
---  
  
## Playing around with Spotify's API (via spotipy)  
Currently just builds a dataset given a list of user ids.  
To get your user id, just visit your Spotify profile:  
Click on the (...) icon -> Share -> Copy Profile Link/URI.  
The user id is the part after the last "/" or ":"    


Might spin this up into a web app later.  
I'm using lyrics.wikia's API to get lyrics info, might switch to Musixmatch later.  

## Disclaimer  
I own none of the data fetched using the API, and do so only for academic purposes. Peace.
