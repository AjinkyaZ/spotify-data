sure\nOh glory\n(Glory, glory) Oh (Glory, glory)\n\n(Verse 1: Common)\nHands to the Heavens, no man, no weapon\nFormed against, yes glory is destined\nEvery day women and men become legends\nSins that go against our skin become blessings\nThe movement is a rhythm to us\nFreedom is like religion to us\nJustice is juxtapositionin' us\nJustice for all just ain't specific enough\nOne son died, his spirit is revisitin' us\nTrue and livin' livin' in us, resistance is us\nThat's why Rosa sat on the bus\nThat's why we walk through Ferguson with our hands up\nWhen it go down we woman and man up\nThey say, \"Stay down\", and we stand up\nShots, we on the ground, the camera panned up\nKing pointed to the mountain top and we ran up\n\nOne day when the glory comes\nIt will be ours, it will be ours\nOne day when the war is won\nWe will be sure, we will be sure\nOh glory\n(Glory, glory) Oh (Glory, glory)\n\n(Bridge: John Legend)\nNow the war is not over, victory isn't won\nBut we'll fight on to the finish, and when it's all done\nWe'll cry glory (glory), oh glory (glory), oh (glory, glory)\nWe'll cry glory, oh glory, oh (glory, glory)\n\n(Verse 2: Common)\nSelma is now for every man, woman and child\nEven Jesus got his crown in front of a crowd\nThey marched with the torch, we gon' run with it now\nNever look back, we done gone hundreds of miles\nFrom dark roads he rose, to become a hero\nFacin' the league of justice, his power was the people\nEnemy is lethal, a king became regal\nSaw the face of Jim Crow under a bald eagle\nThe biggest weapon is to stay peaceful\nWe sing, our music is the cuts that we bleed through\nSomewhere in the dream we had an epiphany\nNow we right the wrongs in history\nNo one can win the war individually\nIt takes the wisdom of the elders and young people's energy\nWelcome to the story we call victory\nThe comin' of the Lord, my eyes have seen the glory\n\nOne day when the glory comes\nIt will be ours, it will be ours\nOne day when the war is won\nWe will be sure, we will be sure\nOh glory\n(Glory, glory) Oh (Glory, glory)\nOh glory\n(Glory, glory) Yeah (Glory, glory)\n(Outro: John Legend)\nWhen the war is won, when it's all said and done\nWe'll cry glory, oh glory (Glory, glory)\n\n112 Follow Embed\nMore on genius", "release_year": "2014", "name": "Glory (From the Motion Picture Selma)", "album_id": "3cZ3dS7ogHb55sWjVzaBnx",

you'll be lonely\nOnce I was eleven years old\n\nI always had that dream like my daddy before me\nSo I started writing songs, I started writing stories\nSomething about the glory, just always seemed to bore me\n'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me\n\nOnce I was 20 years old, my story got told\nBefore the morning sun, when life was lonely\nOnce I was 20 years old\n\nI only see

your life becomes a better one\nI made the man so happy when I wrote a letter once\nI hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month\n\nSoon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is

you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya\n'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over\nIt's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over\n\nBut you

wandering in the everglades,\nI'd one drink but no more.\n\nI was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight, \nGazing up at the stars. \nNot aware of a presence so near to me, \nWatching my every move. \n\nFeeling scared and I fell to my knees, \nAs something rushed me from the trees. \nTook me to an unholy place, \nAnd that is where I fell from grace. \n\nThen they summoned me over to join in with them \nTo the dance of the dead. \nInto the circle of fire I followed them, \nInto the middle I was led. \n\nAs if time had stopped still I was numb with fear, \nBut still I wanted to go. \nAnd the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me, \nAs I walked onto the coals. \n\nAnd I felt I was in a trance, \nAnd my spirit was lifted from me. \nAnd if only someone had the chance \nTo witness what happened to me. \n\nAnd I danced and I pranced and I sang with them, \nAll had death in their eyes. \nLifeless figures, they were undead all of them, \nThey had ascended from hell. \n\nAs I danced with the dead, \nMy free spirit was laughing and howling down at me. \nBelow my undead body just danced the circle of dead. \n\nUntil the time came to reunite us both, \nMy spirit came back down to me. \nI didn't know if I was alive or dead, \nAs the others all joined in with me. \n\nBy luck then a skirmish started, \nAnd took the attention away from me. \nWhen they took their gaze from me, \nWas the moment that I fled. \n\nI ran like hell faster than the wind \nBut behind I did not glance. \nOne thing that I did not dare,\nWas to look just straight ahead. \n\nWhen you know that your time has come around, \nYou know you'll be prepared for it. \nSay your last goodbyes to everyone, \nDrink and say a prayer for it. \n\nWhen you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed, \nAnd you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead. \nWhen you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed, \nAnd you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead. \n\nTo this day I guess I'll never know, \nJust why they let me go. \nBut I'll never go dancing no more, \n'Til I dance with the dead.", "release_year": "2003", "name": "Dance Of Death", "album_id":

true\n\nHey there Delilah\nDon't you worry about the distance\nI'm right there if you get lonely\nGive this song another listen\n\nClose your eyes\nListen to my voice, it's my disguise\nI'm by your side\n\nOh, it's what you do to me\nOh, it's what you do to me\nOh, it's what you do to me\nOh, it's what you do to me\nWhat you do to me\n\nHey there Delilah\nI know times are getting hard\nBut just believe me girl, someday\nI'll pay the bills with this guitar\n\nWe'll have it good\nWe'll have the life we knew we would\nMy word is good\n\nHey there Delilah\nI've got so much left to say\nIf every simple song I wrote to you\nWould take your breath away\n\nI'd write it all\nEven more in love with me you'd fall\nWe'd have it all\n\nOh, it's what you do to me\nOh, it's what you do to me\nOh, it's what you do to me\nOh, it's what you do to me\n\nA thousand miles seems pretty far\nBut they've got planes and trains and cars\nI'd walk to you if I had no other way\nOur friends would all make fun of us\nAnd we'll just laugh along because\nWe know that none of them have felt this way\n\nDelilah I can promise you\nThat by the time we get through\nThe world will never ever be the same\nAnd you're to blame\n\nHey there Delilah\nYou be good and don't you miss me\nTwo more years and you'll be done with school\nAnd I'll be making history\n\nLike I do\nYou'll know it's all because of you\nWe can do whatever we want to\nHey there Delilah, here's to you\nThis one's for you\n\nOh, it's what you do to me\nOh, it's what you do to me\nOh, it's what you do to me\nOh, it's what you do to me\nWhat you do

she said, \"We are all just prisoners here of our own device\"\nAnd in their masters' chambers\nThey gathered for the feast\nThey stab it with their steely knives\nBut they just can't kill the
