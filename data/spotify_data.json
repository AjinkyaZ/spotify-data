lonely\nOnce I was seven years old\n\nIt was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger\nPushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker\nBy eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor\nNever rich so we were out to make that steady figure\n\nOnce I was eleven years old my daddy told me\nGo get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely\nOnce I was eleven years old\n\nI always had that dream like my daddy before me\nSo I started writing songs, I started writing stories\nSomething about the glory, just always seemed to bore me\n'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me\n\nOnce I was 20 years old, my story got told\nBefore the morning sun, when life was lonely\nOnce I was 20 years old\n\nI only see my goals, I don't believe in failure\n'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major\nI got my boys with me at least those in favor\nAnd if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later\n\nOnce I was 20 years old, my story got told\nI was writing about everything, I saw before me\nOnce I was 20 years old\n\nSoon we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold\nWe've traveled around the world and we're still rolling\nSoon we'll be 30 years old\n\nI'm still learning about life\nMy woman brought children for me\nSo I can sing them all my songs\nAnd I can tell them stories\nMost of my boys are with me\nSome are still out seeking glory\nAnd some I had to leave behind\nMy brother I'm still sorry\n\nSoon I'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61\nRemember life and then your life becomes a better one\nI made the man so happy when I wrote a letter once\nI hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month\n\nSoon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold\nOr will I have a lot of children who can warm me\nSoon I'll be 60 years old\nSoon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold\nOr will I have a lot of children who can warm me\nSoon I'll be 60 years old\n\nOnce I was seven years old, my momma told

get it till it's done\nFrom where you are or have begun\nI said keep on try a little harder to see everything you need to be\nBelieve in your dreams\nThat you see when you're asleep\n\nSomeday we

The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless\nAnd it always feels like I'm hittin' the mark\nTill I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart\nLike, \"This shit is garbage!\"\nAnd God's given me all this\nStill I feel no different regardless\nKids look to me as a god, this is retarded\nIf only they knew, it's a facade and it's exhaustive\n\nAnd I try not to listen to nonsense\nBut if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence\nMission accomplished\nI'm not God-sent, Nas, Rakim, Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith, and I'm not Prince\n\nI walk on water\nBut I ain't no Jesus\nI walk on water (it's true, it's true)\nBut only when it freezes\n\n'Cause I'm only human, just like you\nMaking my mistakes, oh if you only knew\nI don't think you should believe in me the way that you do\n'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh\n\nIt's true, I'm a Rubik's, a beautiful mess\nAt times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest\nA flawed human, I guess\nBut I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex-\n\nPectations and meet 'em, but first the \"Speedom\" verse\nNow Big Sean he's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?\nThere was a time I had the world by the balls, eatin' out my palm\nEvery album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on\nAnd now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on\nBut the only one who's looking down on me that matters now's DeShaun\nAm I lucky to be around this long?\n\nBegs the question though, especially after the methadone\nAs yesterday fades and the Dresden home\nIs burnt to the ground, and all that's left of my house is lawn\nThe crowds are gone\nAnd it's time to wash out the blonde\nSales decline, the curtain's drawn\nThey're closin' the set, I'm still pokin' my head from out behind\nAnd everyone who has doubt, remind\n\nNow take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times\nNow let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares or gives a fuck about your rhymes\nAnd as I grow outta sight, outta mind, I might go outta mine\n'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight\nWhen I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?\n\nBut when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine\nI won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine\nBut I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause\n\nI walk on water\nBut I ain't no Jesus\nI walk on water\nBut only when it freezes\n\n'Cause I'm only human, just like you\nI've been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew\nI don't think you should believe in me the way that you do\n'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh\nIf I walked on water, I would drown\n\n'Cause I'm just a man\nBut

moonlight, \nGazing up at the stars. \nNot aware of a presence so near to me, \nWatching my every move. \n\nFeeling scared and I fell to my knees, \nAs something rushed me from the trees. \nTook me to an unholy place, \nAnd that is where I fell from grace. \n\nThen they summoned me over to join in with them \nTo the dance of the dead. \nInto the circle of fire I followed them, \nInto the middle I was led. \n\nAs if time had stopped still I was numb with fear, \nBut still I wanted to go. \nAnd the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me, \nAs I walked onto the coals. \n\nAnd I felt I was in a trance, \nAnd my spirit was lifted from me. \nAnd if only someone had the chance \nTo witness what happened to me. \n\nAnd I danced and I pranced and I sang with them, \nAll had death in their eyes. \nLifeless figures, they were undead all of them, \nThey had ascended from hell. \n\nAs I danced with the dead, \nMy free spirit was laughing and howling down at me. \nBelow my undead body just danced the circle of dead. \n\nUntil the time came to reunite us both, \nMy spirit came back down to me. \nI didn't know if I was alive or dead, \nAs the others all joined in with me. \n\nBy luck then a skirmish started, \nAnd took the attention away from me. \nWhen they took their gaze from me, \nWas the moment that I fled. \n\nI ran like hell faster than the wind \nBut behind I did not glance. \nOne thing that I did not dare,\nWas to look just straight ahead. \n\nWhen you know that your time has come around, \nYou know you'll be prepared for it. \nSay your last goodbyes to everyone, \nDrink and say a prayer for it. \n\nWhen you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed, \nAnd you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead. \nWhen you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed, \nAnd you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead. \n\nTo this day I guess I'll never know, \nJust why they let me go. \nBut I'll never go dancing no more, \n'Til I dance with the dead."}, "7ytqdjooPEAa97QSu6NUHS": {"popularity": 59, "album_id": "0SijqGUUCbaYy7jk9cCBSg", "artist_id": "1bs7HoMkSyQwcobCpE9KpN", "artist": "The Mamas & The Papas", "album": "The Papas & The

dark with you between my arms\nBarefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song\nWhen you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath\nBut you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight\n\nWell I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know\nShe shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home\nI found a love to carry more than just my secrets\nTo carry love, to carry children of our own\n\nWe are still kids, but we're so in love\nFighting against all odds\nI know we'll be alright this time\nDarling, just hold my hand\nBe my girl, I'll be your man\nI see my future in your eyes\n\nBaby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms\nBarefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song\nWhen I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful\nI don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight\n\nBaby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms\nBarefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song\nI have faith in what I see\nNow I know I have met an angel in person\nAnd she looks perfect\nI don't deserve this\nYou look perfect tonight"}, "40YcuQysJ0KlGQTeGUosTC": {"popularity": 83, "album_id": "09Q3WwGYsQe5ognkvVkmCu", "artist_id":

here\n\nHer mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends, uh\nShe got a lot of pretty, pretty boys that she calls friends\nHow they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat\nSome dance to remember, some dance to forget\n\nSo I called up the Captain\n\"Please bring me my wine!\"\nHe said, \"We haven't had that spirit here since 1969\"\nAnd still those voices are calling from far

in their masters' chambers\nThey gathered for the feast\nThey stab it with their steely knives\nBut they just can't kill the beast\n\nLast thing I remember, I was\nRunning for the door\nI had to find

forever like John Sousa never fade\nHe had a beautiful child, named her Desir\u00e9e\nHope I'm remembered for the things that I never made\n'Cause you don't have to make a sound\nWhen they got what

you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya\n'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over\nIt's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over\n\nBut you

crazy as it seems\nMaybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano\nAll I know is I love you too much to walk away though\n\nCome inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk\nDon't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk\nTold you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball\nNext time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall\n\nNext time, there will be no next time, I apologize\nEven though I know it's lies, I'm tired of the games\nI just want her back, I know I'm a liar\nIf she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire\n\nRihanna:\nJust

figured things out\nBut I guess I'm a letdown\nBut it's cool, I checked out\nOh, you wanna be friends now?\nOkay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now\nSit around and talk about the good

bedrooms (Uhh-uhh-uhh!)\nSometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose but can't\nBut it's cool for <span class=\"plainlinks\">Tom Green</span> to hump a dead moose\n\n\"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips\"\nAnd if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss\nAnd that's the message that we deliver to little kids\nAnd expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is\n\nOf course they're gonna know what intercourse is by the time they hit fourth grade\nThey got the Discovery Channel, don't they?\nWe ain't nothing but mammals... well, some of us, cannibals\nWho cut other people open like cantaloupes\n\nBut if we can hump dead animals and antelopes\nThen there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope (eugh!)\nBut if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote\nWomen wave your pantyhose; sing the chorus, and it goes\n\nI'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady\nAll you other Slim Shadys are just imitating\nSo won't the real Slim Shady please stand up\nPlease stand up, please stand up?\n\n'Cause Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady\nAll you other Slim Shadys are just imitating\nSo won't the real Slim Shady please stand up\nPlease stand up, please stand up?\n\nWill Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records\nWell I do, so fuck him and fuck you, too\nYou think I give a damn about a Grammy?\nHalf o' you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me\n\n\"But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?\"\nWhy, so you guys can just lie to get me here?\nSo you can sit me here next to <span class=\"plainlinks\">Britney Spears</span>?\nYo shit, <span class=\"plainlinks\">Christina Aguilera</span> better switch me chairs\n\nSo I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst\nAnd hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first\nLittle bitch put me on blast on MTV\n\"Yeah he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hehe\"\n\nI should download her audio on MP3\nAnd show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (ahh!)\nI'm sick of you little girl and boy groups; all you do is annoy me\nSo I have been sent here to destroy you\n\nAnd there's a million of us just like me\nWho cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me\nWho dress like me, walk, talk, and act like me\nAnd just might be the next best thing but not quite me\n\n'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady\nAll you other Slim Shadys are just imitating\nSo won't the real Slim Shady please stand up\nPlease stand up, please stand up?\n\n'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady\nAll you other Slim Shadys are just imitating\nSo won't the real Slim Shady please stand up\nPlease stand up, please stand up?\n\nI'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only giving you\nThings you joke about with your friends, inside your livin' room\nThe only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all\nAnd I don't gotta be false or sugar-coat it all\n\nI just get on the mic and spit it\nAnd whether you like to admit it (rip), I just shit it\nBetter than ninety percent of you rappers out can\nThen you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums\n\nIt's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm thirty\nI'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting\nPinchin' nurses asses, while I'm jackin' off with Jergens\nAnd I'm jerkin', but this whole bag of Viagra isn't workin'\n\nIn every single person there's a Slim Shady lurkin'\nWho could be workin' at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings\nOr in the parking lot circling, screamin' \"I don't give a fuck\"\nWith his windows down and his system up\n\nSo will the real Shady please stand up\nAnd put one of those fingers on each hand up\nAnd be proud to be outta your mind and outta control\nAnd one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?\n\n'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady\nAll you other Slim Shadys are just imitating\nSo won't the real Slim Shady please stand up\nPlease stand up, please stand up?\n\n'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm

triumph\nThis is for the warrior, this is for you and I\nThis is for euphoria, give me a piece of mind\nGod is recordin' this, won't you look in the sky?\nTell him you got the behavior of your neighbor\nEven when stability's never in your favor\nFly with the turbulence, only last a minute\nLand on your dreams, and recognize you live it\nWalk through the valley of peace, with bare FEET (whoa)\nRun through the flames, that's more passion for ME (whoa)\nI passed that, this morning just so the world can SEE (whoa)\nGot them wolves on me, no watch me lick 'em clean\nI know, I know, my pride, my goals, my highs, my lows\nI know, I know, it's mind control\nI know I could prosper, no impostor, prosecute my posture\nI stand up and I stand by her, what\n\nAlicia Keys:\nI am a freedom fighter, the name that history wrote\nAnd even through disaster, eye of the tiger for hope\nI'm tryin' to find my way back, there's no day off for heroes\nAnd even when I'm tired, go is the only word I know\n\nAlicia Keys:\nAnd the night is takin' over, and the moonlight gets exposure\nAnd the players have been chosen, and it seems like fate has spoken\nWhen it seems your faith has broken, by the second, losin' focus\nAin't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off - unless you move forward\n\nAlicia Keys:\nI bet they wonder hoooooow, I go on, go on\nI bet they wonder hoooooow, I go on, go on\nI'll simply say \"it's on again, it's on again\" - whoa-oh\nThe world don't stop, it's on again, it's on again - whoa-oh\n\nAlicia Keys:\nI am a lonely hero, tryin' to fight my battles\nLife likes to blow the cold wind, sometimes it freezes my shadow\nIn the midst of all this darkness, I sacrifice my ego\nThere ain't no room for selfish, we do it for the people\n\nAlicia Keys:\nSay the work don't stop, 'cause they don't stop\nAnd everybody here tryna get on top\nEverybody from the 'burbs down to the block\nGotta hold on tight and don't let go, let go\nHuh, so you think you hot?\nGotta grind hard, give it all you got\nYou can have, or you can have not\nYou see that a lot in the ghetto, ghetto"}, "5j6ZZwA9BnxZi5Bk0Ng4jB": {"popularity": 76, "album_id": "3lFioPGhn7x5Y3H3YbPV83",

bombs, but he keeps on forgetting\n\nWhat he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud\nHe opens his mouth, but the words won't come out\nHe's chokin' how, everybody's jokin' now\nThe clocks runs out, time's up, over, blow\n\nSnap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity, oh\nThere goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't\nGive up that easy no, he won't have it he knows\nHis whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter he's dope\n \nHe knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant he knows\nWhen he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's\nBack to the lab again yo, this whole

known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads God only knows\n\nHe's grown farther from home, he's no father\nHe goes home, and barely knows his own daughter\nBut hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water\nThese hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product\n\nThey moved on to the next schmoe who flows\nHe nose dove and sold nada, so the soap opera\nIs told and unfolds, I suppose it's old

there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life\n\nAnd these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder\nTryin' to feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter\nCaught up between bein' a father and a Prima Donna\nBaby mama drama screamin' on and too much for me to wanna\n\nStay in one spot, another day of monotony\nHas gotten me to the point I'm like a snail I've got\nTo formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot\nSuccess is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not\n\nMom I love you, but this trailer's got to go\nI cannot grow old in Salem's Lot\nSo here I go, it's my shot, feet fail me not\nThis may be the only opportunity that I got\n\nYou better lose yourself in the music, the moment\nYou own it, you better never let it go\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your

under a bald eagle\nThe biggest weapon is to stay peaceful\nWe sing, our music is the cuts that we bleed through\nSomewhere in the dream we had an epiphany\nNow we right the wrongs in history\nNo one can win the war individually\nIt takes the wisdom of the elders and young people's energy\nWelcome to the story we call victory\nThe comin' of the Lord, my eyes have seen the glory\n\nOne day when the

I've been through the desert on a horse with no name\nIt felt good to be out of the rain\nIn the desert you can remember your name\n'Cause there ain't no-one for to give you no pain\n\nLalala...\n\nAfter nine days I let the horse run free\n'Cause the desert had turned to sea\nThere were plants and birds and rocks and things\nThere was sand and hills and rings\n\nThe ocean is a desert with it's life underground\nAnd a perfect disguise above\nUnder the cities lies a heart made of ground\nBut the humans will give no love\n\nYou see, I've been through the desert on a horse
