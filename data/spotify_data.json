morning from the bell in Gardiners Bay\nLike all the locals here I've had to sell my home\nToo proud to leave I work my fingers to the bone\n\nSo I could own my Downeaster Alexa\nAnd I go where the ocean is deep\nThere are giants out there in the canyons\nAnd a good captain can't fall asleep\n\nI got bills to pay and children who need clothes\nI know there's fish out there but where, God only knows\nThey say these waters aren't what they used to be\nBut I've got people back on land who count on me\n\nSo if you see my Downeaster Alexa\nAnd if you work with the rod and the reel\nTell my wife I am trolling Atlantis\nAnd I still have my hands on the wheel\n\nNow I drive my Downeaster Alexa\nMore and more miles from shore every year\nSince they told me I can't sell no stripers\nAnd there's no luck in swordfishing here\n\nI was a Bayman like my father was before\nCan't make a living as a Bayman anymore\nThere ain't much future for a man who works the sea\nBut there ain't no island left

sing, our music is the cuts that we bleed through\nSomewhere in the dream we had an epiphany\nNow we right the wrongs in history\nNo one can win the war individually\nIt takes the wisdom of the elders

everglades,\nI'd one drink but no more.\n\nI was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight, \nGazing up at the stars. \nNot aware of a presence so near to me, \nWatching my every move. \n\nFeeling scared and I fell to my knees, \nAs something rushed me from the trees. \nTook me to an unholy place, \nAnd that is where I fell from grace. \n\nThen they summoned me over to join in with them \nTo the dance of the dead. \nInto the circle of fire I followed them, \nInto the middle I was led. \n\nAs if time had stopped still I was numb with fear, \nBut still I wanted to go. \nAnd the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me, \nAs I walked onto the coals. \n\nAnd I felt I was in a trance, \nAnd my spirit was lifted from me. \nAnd if only someone had the chance \nTo witness what happened to me. \n\nAnd I danced and I pranced and I sang with them, \nAll had death in their eyes. \nLifeless figures, they were undead all of them, \nThey had ascended from hell. \n\nAs I danced with the dead, \nMy free spirit was laughing and howling down at me. \nBelow my undead body just danced the circle of dead. \n\nUntil the time came to reunite us both, \nMy spirit came back down to me. \nI didn't know if I was alive or dead, \nAs the others all joined in with me. \n\nBy luck then a skirmish started, \nAnd took the attention away from me. \nWhen they took their gaze from me, \nWas the moment that I fled. \n\nI ran like hell faster than the wind \nBut behind I did not glance. \nOne thing that I did not dare,\nWas to look just straight ahead. \n\nWhen you know that your time has come around, \nYou know you'll be prepared for it. \nSay your last goodbyes to everyone, \nDrink and say a prayer for it. \n\nWhen you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed, \nAnd you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead. \nWhen you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed, \nAnd you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead. \n\nTo this day I guess I'll never know, \nJust why they let me go. \nBut I'll never go dancing no more, \n'Til I dance with the dead.", "tempo": 130.457, "popularity": 0.55, "instrumentalness": 0.00691, "genres": []},

the last sights\nOf a world that has gone very wrong for me\n\nCan it be that there's some sort of error?\nHard to stop the surmounting terror\nIs it really the end, not some crazy dream?\n\nSomebody please tell me that I'm dreaming\nIt's not easy to stop from screaming\nBut words escape me when I try to speak\n\nTears fall, but why am I crying?\nAfter all, I'm not afraid of dying\nDon't I believe that there never is an end?\n\nAs the guards march me out to the courtyard\nSomebody cries from a cell, \"God be with you\"\nIf there's a God, why has he let me go?\n\nAs I walk, my life drifts before me\nThough the end is near, I'm not sorry\nCatch my soul, it's willing to fly away\n\nMark my words, believe my soul lives on\nDon't worry now that I have gone\nI've gone beyond to see the truth\n\nWhen you know that your time is close at hand\nMaybe then you'll begin to understand\nLife down here is just a strange illusion\n\nYeah yeah yeah, hallowed be thy name\nYeah yeah yeah,

started writing songs, I started writing stories\nSomething about the glory, just always seemed to bore me\n'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me\n\nOnce I was 20 years old, my story got told\nBefore the morning sun, when life was lonely\nOnce I was 20 years old\n\nI only see my goals, I don't believe in failure\n'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major\nI got my boys with me at least those in favor\nAnd if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later\n\nOnce I was 20 years old, my story got told\nI was writing about everything, I saw before me\nOnce I was 20 years old\n\nSoon we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold\nWe've traveled around the world and we're still rolling\nSoon we'll be 30 years old\n\nI'm still learning about

brother I'm still sorry\n\nSoon I'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61\nRemember life and then your life becomes a better one\nI made the man so happy when I wrote a letter once\nI hope my children
